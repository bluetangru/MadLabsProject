            <p>CSS (or Cascading Style Sheets) is what gives the bare bones of HTML its 'pizzazz'. It is used to make the webpage look more appealing and adds styles.</p>
            <p>A few things which have tripped me up with CSS include remembering whether a certain selector is a class or an ID as using the incorrect one will not apply the desired style. Another thing which has given me trouble is the proprerties of flex...I have to sit and patiently go through the options until I find the one I want/need because I can never remeber fully how it works and which one I want.</p>
            <p>In the Semainar 06/04/23 we did a quick recap on the above but also covered flexbox (especially in regards to images and making them responsive on the page) and looked at adding a nav bar to the top of the page.</p>
            <p>During my own study to prepare for the homework set, which is to share our webpages for peer review, I have found out how to centre an image for a banner, for example, (see the image below) and also I have looked at how to use CSS to include a floating navbar drop down to include more content in the navbar without it becoming too cluttered.</p>
