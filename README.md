# MadLabsProject

##Project
This is the project I created for the MadLabs *Welcome to Web Development* course.

23-04-23 Addendum:
  I have no finished the project as best as I can. It has been a struggle at times to get what im wanting in my head onto the screen but all-in-all I am very happy with how it has turned out.
  This is my first front-end developed website (although still rough around the edges) I am incredibly pleased with how it has turned out!
  
  If anyone does decide to read this, I hope you like it and please dont give me too many harsh comments, haha.
