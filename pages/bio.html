            <h1 class="md-header">About Me!</h1>
            <!--<p>I was born on 22nd December 1997 in Preston, Lancashire to Alison and Simon Ashcroft. I have 1 (one) older sister who is called Catherine.</p> -->
			<p>I attended All Hallows Roman Catholic High School and I left with 13 GCSEs and attained 3 A Levels and 1 AS Level in German, Modern History, Government &amp; Politics and Classical History respectively at Blessed Cardinal Newman College.</p>
            <p>At 18 I went to the University of Chester and studied History, completing my dissertation on the American Excellence argument for the Nuclear Age. While at university I was a member of the University of Chester rowing team for 2 1/2 years and raced in Nottingham and London to name a few and also did rowing privately for a prestigious team on the Chester River Dee. Chester is where I met my husband Alex and we live together in Bramhall and have recently got married on 25th February 2023.</p>

                <p id="tragic">In 2019 my father Simon passed away after an 18 month battle with Brain Cancer. In 2020 my father-in-law passed away after complications with surgery. I am using these tragic backstory elements as either my super villain origin story or for my upcoming XFactor audition to get sympathy votes as I cannot sing in the slightest.</p>
