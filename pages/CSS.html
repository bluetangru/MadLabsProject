            <ul class="content-li">
                <li>In-line styles</li>
                <li>External stylesheets</li>

            <p>CSS (or Cascading Style Sheets) is what gives the bare bonesof HTML its 'looks'. It is used to make the webpage look more appealing and adds 'style'.</p>
            <p>A few things which have tripped me up with CSS is remembering if it is a class or an ID I have used as a selector whivh using the wrong one willnot carry over the assigned style. Another thing which has always given me trouble is the proprerties of flex...I have to sit and patiently go through the options until I find the one I want/need because I can never remeber fully how it works and which one I want.</p>
            <p>In the Semainar 06/04/23 we did a quick recap on the above but also covered flexbox (especially in regards to images and making them responsive on the page) and looked at adding a nav bar to the top of the page.</p>
            <p>During my own study to prepare for the homework set, which is to share our webpages for peer review, I have found out how to centre an image (for a banner, for example) which is shown in the image below.</p>
